# Find the hat

I developed a solution to the 'Find your hat' challenge project on Codecademy using JavaScript (ES6). The goal of the project is to build an interactive terminal game where the player must navigate through a field full of holes to find their lost hat without falling or going out of bounds.

To run the game, you'll need to download and install Node.js and NPM. Once installed, run the command 'node main.js' to start the game.
